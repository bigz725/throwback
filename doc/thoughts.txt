1.  After the data import, I ran this query, thinking it should identify duplicate pitches:
select 
pitch1.id, pitch2.id, 
pitch1.game_id, pitch2.game_id, 
pitch1.batter_id, pitch2.batter_id, 
pitch1.pitcher_id, pitch2.pitcher_id, 
pitch1.pitch_result, pitch2.pitch_result 
from 
pitches pitch1 
inner join pitches pitch2 on 
    (pitch1.id != pitch2.id and pitch1.game_id = pitch2.game_id and pitch1.pitch_per_game = pitch2.pitch_per_game 
      and pitch1.inning = pitch2.inning and pitch1.top_of_inning = pitch2.top_of_inning and 
      pitch1.pitcher_id = pitch2.pitcher_id);


There are 20 records, each with "pitch_per_game" being 0.  Most of the records have different pitch results.
Once those are excluded, it appears there are no duplicates.  I don't know what to make of a "pitch_per_game" being 0.

  


2.  Attempting to determine the precise meaning of pitch_plate_location_x and _z:
My thoughts with X are that 0 is right down the middle of the plate.  Since the plate is 17 inches across, that means
the horizontal strike zone values should be between -8.5 inches and +8.5 inches (the stat is given in feet, so conversion is 
necessary).  

There are approximately 40,000 pitches that were not swung at where the absolute value of x was greater than 8.5/12 feet.
Approximately 32,000 of them (80%) were called balls; a little over 600 (1.5%) were intentional balls, pitchouts, or resulted
in a hit batter.  The remaining were called strikes.

Balls are a different story, but it's late at the moment.
