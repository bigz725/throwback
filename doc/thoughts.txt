1.  After the data import, I ran this query, thinking it should identify duplicate pitches:
select 
pitch1.id, pitch2.id, 
pitch1.game_id, pitch2.game_id, 
pitch1.batter_id, pitch2.batter_id, 
pitch1.pitcher_id, pitch2.pitcher_id, 
pitch1.pitch_result, pitch2.pitch_result 
from 
pitches pitch1 
inner join pitches pitch2 on 
    (pitch1.id != pitch2.id and pitch1.game_id = pitch2.game_id and pitch1.pitch_per_game = pitch2.pitch_per_game 
      and pitch1.inning = pitch2.inning and pitch1.top_of_inning = pitch2.top_of_inning and 
      pitch1.pitcher_id = pitch2.pitcher_id);


There are 20 records, each with "pitch_per_game" being 0.  Most of the records have different pitch results.
Once those are excluded, it appears there are no duplicates.  I don't know what to make of a "pitch_per_game" being 0.

2.  Attempting to determine the precise meaning of pitch_plate_location_x and _z:
My thoughts with X are that 0 is right down the middle of the plate.  Since the plate is 17 inches across, that means
the horizontal strike zone values should be between -8.5 inches and +8.5 inches (the stat is given in feet, so conversion is 
necessary).  

There are approximately 40,000 pitches that were not swung at where the absolute value of x was greater than 8.5/12 feet.
Approximately 32,000 of them (80%) were called balls; a little over 600 (1.5%) were intentional balls, pitchouts, or resulted
in a hit batter.  The remaining were called strikes.

Out of 348 hit batter outcomes, all but 2 had an absolute X value greater than 1.  Hit lefties typically result in a positive value.
Hit righties all result in a negaive value.  I'm a little suspicious about the low 
called ball rate from the previous paragraph, but it seems reasonable to conclude that 0 is right down the middle of the plate. 

3.  I really wish I had had the Y data for pitch_plate_location.  I would have been very interested in doing a strikezone scatterplot.

4.  I chose to keep the existing IDs from the spreadsheet for pitchers, batters, and games.  In hindsight, I didn't use
the batter entity all that much.  During the import of data, if a table has a regular primary key (an incrementing integer of some size),
then the database will provide the ID when the record is created.  I did not want to have to save the record to get the entity id and hold it
for later use, this would likely require importing record by record (and entity by entity within each record).  
Instead, I chose to read the CSV entirely, create the model objects in memory,and use the ActiveRecord-Import gem 
functionality on the collection of objects (which is much faster than calling the ActiveRecord create method repeatedly).

5.  I imagine that importing via pure SQL would probably be faster than instantiating Ruby objects and saving them,
but it seemed more error prone. Even on my "production" virtual machine, which is running on an older computer with more limited
capabilities, an import doesn't take longer than 10 minutes.  My approach to performance is to make sure the behavior is
correct first, then refine performance if requirements force it.
  
6.  Breaking out the pitch_result into a separate table, with a number of boolean attributes, 
allows for easy filtering of outcomes when joined to the pitches table.  Rather than explicitly list 
all the codes that indicate, say, a strike (and risk error), one can simply join the selected pitches
to pitch_results and add a 'pitch_results.strike = true' criteria to the 'WHERE' clause.
Need to narrow it further to swinging strikes (whiffs)?  Replace the WHERE with
'pitch_results.swinging = true and contact = false'.

7.  I used the Highcharts Javascript library for the line charts (Pitches per Game and Velocity).  
The pitch summary table was done with raw ERB/HTML.  The pie chart (Pitch Breakdown) was done with the Rails Kickchart
library, which itself uses the Google Charts Javascript library.  
Highcharts is only free for personal non-commercial use, so in a production environment 
with the Royals this would have to be considered.  

8.  Besides activerecord-import, Highcharts, Google Charts, and kickchart, 
other libraries I used were "Faker" (for fake pitcher/batter names and fake game dates), 
"will_paginate" for paginating big collections, "pry" for debugging, and the Blueprint CSS framework.
